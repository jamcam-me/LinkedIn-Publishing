## VIDEO SCRIPT 1: “Cybersecurity Due Diligence”

**Opening (10s):**
“Hi everyone, James Cameron here… I actually dropped this post back in December thinking it might go viral. It didn’t. Which is weird, because it’s basically a playbook for understanding how not to torch millions in a deal. But maybe the holidays weren’t the right time to talk about exploding costs due to overseen liabilities and what ends up as down‑round disasters.”

**Transition (3 s)**
“Now it’s April, deals are heating back up — and this post hits even harder.”

**Core Message (25–30s):**
“In M\&A, security, observability and inherited risk are the cards that no one takes a look at… until the hand’s already over.
62% of deals over \$250 M show security, data and policy red flags — many discovered only post‑close. Buyers inherit legacy risks, shadow IT, exposed AI pipelines, and bad infrastructure. Suddenly that shiny acquisition goes from a tidy migration to a compromise recovery or infrastructure redesign project.
This isn’t about tech debt. It’s about deal value. And sometimes, survival.”

**CTA (10s):**
“If you’re a buyer, board member, or founder gearing up for a transaction—don’t end up on the wrong side of these risk jokers after you’ve signed the dotted line. Check out my article and make sure luck isn’t your only plan for securing your deals!”

## VIDEO SCRIPT 2: “Five Cyber Traps That Kill M\&A Value”

**Opening (10s):**
“Hi everyone James Cameron here. In my previous post, I covered cyber due diligence’s impact on deal value. Sticking to the poker theme—some hands look incredibly strong until you flip the last card. Cyber traps are the wildcards that turn a sure thing into a sunk cost.”

**Middle (30s):**
“My newest article covers five of the biggest traps I see at diligence:

* Shadow IT & Ghost Systems
* AI Misuse & LLM Data Leakage
* Dormant Access & Inherited Credentials
* Third‑Party Sprawl
* Data Classification Chaos
  These aren’t edge cases—I’ve seen them at nearly every client. When investors miss security and governance in diligence, it can be a very painful experience. They’re the missing cards that can cost you the pot.”

**CTA (10s):**
“Check out my article for a real‑world checklist—so you don’t get outplayed by a blind spot.”

## VIDEO SCRIPT 3: “The River Card That Changes Everything”

**Opening (10s):**
“Founders, if you’re chasing investment but skipping cybersecurity, you’re not building value—you’re building a bluff. Valuations get cut when confidence cracks—and it only takes one unanswered risk to fold the hand.”

**Bridge (5s):**
“Investors aren’t just betting on your growth—they’re checking how many blind spots you scaled with.”

**Middle (30s):**
“This post breaks down how your cybersecurity—or lack of it—directly impacts how attractive you are to investors. Shared admin access, ghost AI projects, forgotten vendors—they all drag valuation. But with governance, visibility and a plan—even a simple one—you deal yourself a better hand.”

**CTA (10s):**
“Read the post. Because knowing your security risks—and owning them—isn’t just smart defense. It’s how you raise on your terms.”

## VIDEO SCRIPT 4: “From Due Diligence to Durable Value”

**Opening (10s):**
“You closed the deal. Congrats… now what? James Cameron here to tell you that signing doesn’t end the game. Anyone who’s lived through post‑merger regret knows—the biggest losses show up after the win.”

**Middle (30s):**
“This one’s for founders, investors and acquirers. If IAM isn’t aligned, infrastructure tangled, or the business relies on public GenAI with no controls—if compliance is ‘to be determined’—you haven’t secured the deal, you’ve just moved the risk in‑house. Post‑merger cybersecurity isn’t overhead. It’s where value compounds—or collapses.”

**CTA (10s):**
“Read the article. Because the best closers don’t just win—they make sure the house doesn’t burn down after the deal.”

**Visual Concept:**
Final poker table: one player stacking chips (growth), the other flipping “Trust” and losing. Vault icon and Evergreen Green lighting signal secured integration.
