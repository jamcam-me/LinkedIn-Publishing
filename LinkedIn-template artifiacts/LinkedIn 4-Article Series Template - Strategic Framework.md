## Consolidated Process Framework (from Context7 Principles)

Leveraging principles from Upstash Workflow, a robust content publishing process framework involves the following stages:

1.  **Initiation/Trigger:**
    *   **Purpose:** Start the content creation or publishing workflow.
    *   **Examples:** A new topic idea is approved, a content brief is created, or a series planning phase begins.
    *   **Context7 Parallel:** `context.requestPayload` for receiving initial input, `client.trigger` for manually starting a workflow.

2.  **Sequential Processing/Atomic Steps:**
    *   **Purpose:** Execute discrete, trackable, and potentially retryable operations.
    *   **Examples:** Conducting research, outlining articles, drafting individual sections, creating visual assets, performing SEO optimization, QA checks, sending content for review.
    *   **Context7 Parallel:** `context.run("step-name", async () => { /* operation */ })` for encapsulating atomic steps, `context.call("external-service", { url, method, body })` for interacting with external services (e.g., AI for content generation, image processing APIs).

3.  **Conditional Logic/Branching:**
    *   **Purpose:** Manage alternative paths based on specific criteria or outcomes.
    *   **Examples:** Content requiring approval (if approved, proceed; else, revise), A/B testing variations, handling content rejections.
    *   **Context7 Parallel:** `if (condition) { /* branch A */ } else { /* branch B */ }`

4.  **Time-Based Delays/Waiting for Events:**
    *   **Purpose:** Introduce pauses or wait for external triggers to maintain publishing schedules or manage review cycles.
    *   **Examples:** Scheduling posts for a future date, waiting for stakeholder feedback, timed follow-ups after publication.
    *   **Context7 Parallel:** `context.sleep("delay-name", duration)` for fixed delays, `context.sleep_until("event-time", timestamp)` for pausing until a specific time, `context.waitForEvent("event-name", eventId, { timeout })` for external event triggers (e.g., user engagement, analytics report generation).

5.  **Iteration/Loops:**
    *   **Purpose:** Handle recurring tasks or ongoing content management.
    *   **Examples:** Managing a continuous content series, evergreen content updates, periodic performance reviews.
    *   **Context7 Parallel:** `while (true) { /* recurring task */ }` for continuous monitoring or recurring process.

6.  **Sub-Workflow Invocation:**
    *   **Purpose:** Delegate specific complex tasks to independent, reusable workflows.
    *   **Examples:** Triggering a dedicated workflow for detailed series performance analysis, generating social media snippets or carousel content from a published article, managing multi-platform distribution.
    *   **Context7 Parallel:** `context.invoke("sub-workflow-name", { workflow: anotherWorkflow, ... })` for calling and awaiting sub-workflows.

7.  **Termination/Completion:**
    *   **Purpose:** Mark the end of a workflow run.
    *   **Examples:** Final publication of an article, archiving completed content, stopping follow-up campaigns once a goal is met.
    *   **Context7 Parallel:** `return;` for normal completion, `context.cancel()` for conditional termination.
