## #LV Style Requirements

-   **Minimal Bullets:** Use narrative flow instead of list-heavy sections.
-   **Strategic Storytelling:** Weave data into stories, not standalone statistics.
-   **Global Perspective:** European base with worldwide examples, ensuring all geographies feel understood and build trust.
-   **Humor Elements:** 2-3 subtle instances per article (Norm MacDonald/Seinfeld/Bill Burr style), broadly understood by business owners and security people, and not losing context. Provide a reference where the humor of the comedians has been used.
